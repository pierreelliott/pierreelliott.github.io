I haven't been able to have much professional experiences in the IT field, but I have done a 3 month internship during my DUT at the [LIRIS][5] (a french research laboratory in IT).

### Internship at the LIRIS

This internship was done in the [SMA team][6] (Multi-Agent Systems) which is part of [Behaviors.ai][7], a joint laboratory between the SMA team and [Hoomano][8].

The goal of this internship was to create a web version of the pedagogical game [Little A.I.][9], used to explain the principles of developmental artificial intelligence.

A demo of my work can be found [here][10].
