# Presentation

I am 22 years old and am currently in the 4th year of an engineering diploma at [Polytech Lyon](https://polytech.univ-lyon1.fr/). I already have finished a DUT Informatique (a 2 year diploma in computing) at the [IUT Lyon 1](https://iut.univ-lyon1.fr/). I'm french and live in Lyon for my studies.

I am fond of web technologies and like to create things (no matter what they are).

## Little A.I.

For my internship at the [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) (a french computing research laboratory) in the [SMA team](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipes?id=74) (Multi-Agent Systems), I had to recreate a web version of the [Little A.I.](http://little-ai.com) game (only available on the Apple Store for now).

# Insanity

Insanity is a little WarioWare-like game written in Python, made during an english course in the [IUT Lyon 1](https://iut.univ-lyon1.fr/) on a RaspBerry Pi. The game is itself a succession of mini-games that (should) chain quickly and put a strain on the player. The mini-games are varied (from the simon game to a maze) and come from various sources (we didn't write them).

## Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

It's a very simple game which expands the basic rules of Shifumi (Rock-Paper-Scissors) to make it more challenging.

For now, you can only play against the computer (who plays randomly).  
But I plan to add a multiplayer mode.

## Solar System

This is a "simulation" (which is not realistic actually) of our Solar system.

For now you can only zoom and move the camera a little bit (commands work with touch gesture and keyboard).

## Paint Online

The goal is to have a Paint-like online tool. Not something really complex (just as the Windows' one), but with enough features to make it useful and useable.

For now, you can change the thickness of the pen, change its color, have an eraser (its basically a white color pen) and erase the entire drawable area.
