## Projects

### Little A.I.

For my internship at the LIRIS (a french computing research laboratory) in the SMA team (Syst√®mes Multi-Agents), I have to recreate a web version of the [Little A.I.](http://little-ai.com) game (only available on the Apple Store for now).

* You can find a demo [here](https://pierreelliott.github.io/LittleAI-Web).
* And the GitHub repository is [right there](https://github.com/pierreelliott/LittleAI-Web).

### Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

It's a very simple game which expands the basic rules of Shifumi to make it more challenging.

For now, you can only play against the computer (who plays randomly).  
But I plan to add a multiplayer mode.

* You can find a demo [here](https://pierreelliott.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock).
* And the GitHub repository is [right there](https://github.com/pierreelliott/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock).

### Solar System

This is a "simulation" (absolutely not realistic, for now...) of our Solar system.

There are still some annoying bugs (it doesn't rescale with the window) but you can zoom by scrolling and move the camera (a little bit) with the keyboard's arrows.

* You can find a demo [here](https://pierreelliott.github.io/SolarSystem/).
* And the GitHub repository is [right there](https://github.com/pierreelliott/SolarSystem).
