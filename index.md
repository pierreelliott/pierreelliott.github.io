This is my personal website (thanks to [GitHub](https://pages.github.com)) which I will use as a online profile and a projects portfolio.

## Projects

### Little A.I.

For my internship at the LIRIS (a french computing research laboratory) in the SMA team (Systèmes Multi-Agents), I have to recreate a web version of the [Little A.I.](http://little-ai.com) game (only available on the Apple Store for now).

* You can find a demo [here](https://pierreelliott.github.io/LittleAI-Web).
* And the GitHub repositery is [right there](https://github.com/pierreelliott/LittleAI-Web).

### Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

It's a very simple game which expands the basic rules of Shifumi to make it more challenging.

For now, you can only play against the computer (who plays randomly).  
But I plan to add a multiplayer mode.
