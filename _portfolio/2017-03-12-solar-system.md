This is a "simulation" (which is not realistic actually) of our Solar system.

For now you can only zoom and move the camera a little bit (commands work with touch gesture and keyboard).

* You can find a demo [here](https://pierreelliott.github.io/SolarSystem/).
* While the GitHub repository is [right there](https://github.com/pierreelliott/SolarSystem).
