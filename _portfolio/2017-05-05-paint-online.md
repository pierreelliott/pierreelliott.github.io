The goal is to have a Paint-like online tool. Not something really complex (just as the Windows' one), but with enough features to make it useful and useable.

For now, you can change the thickness of the pen, change its color, have an eraser (its basically a white color pen) and erase the entire drawable area.

* You can find a demo [here](https://pierreelliott.github.io/PaintOnline/).
* While the GitHub repository is [right there](https://github.com/pierreelliott/PaintOnline).
