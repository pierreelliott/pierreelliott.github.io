Insanity is a little WarioWare-like game written in Python, made during an english course in the [IUT Lyon 1](https://iut.univ-lyon1.fr/) on a RaspBerry Pi. The game is itself a succession of mini-games that (should) chain quickly and put a strain on the player. The mini-games are varied (from the simon game to a maze) and come from various sources (we didn't write them).
